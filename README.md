This is the repository of Stock Market analysis and forecasting stock price

# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

The goal is to predict the closing stock price of Apple, Google, and IBM after 5 days into the future from the historical data. Also, analyse and visualise the stock price variables for these companies.

This project analyses the stock market data of the technology companies individually and finds the correlation between stock price data of different technology companies. Also, the objective of this project is to develop and evaluate models LSTM, GRU, CNN and MLP that can effectively be used for stock price forecasting of the companies Apple, Google, and IBM

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the stock market data for 3 technology companies i.e., Apple, Google, and IBM from 5th Oct 2016 to 4th October 2021. It has been acquired from the link: https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup
